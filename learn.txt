i think the dev club of IITD is not to that level as it was started only a few years ago.
 there are some other explainations to that some people join this club and when they find that its not to that level right now they leave without thinking that they can mentor this club of thye think they have gained more knowledge than any othery member of club. i am saying this because i have meet somne seniors who left this club to learn on their own and some other similar resons.
also i didn't found any activity od our dev club except on github.some projects were really good like that that acessing grades outside campus script. i haven't tried it but i was actually thinking that there must be a way coz reasult just came and was at my home when i got the news about result. at last i think dev club isn't that famous that,s why i want to join it as journey will be more intresting
